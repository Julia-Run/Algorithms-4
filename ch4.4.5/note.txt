Assumptions: weighted, DirectedEdge, No Circle, weight are allowed to be negative
Question: find min path within linear time.
Answer: Using Dijkstra and Topological order;
This can be applied to Paralell mission allocation with prioraty limited;

1st Time:
DijkstraMinPath
PathMin

2nd Time:
Dijkstra
TopoMIN
